        Advantage And Disadvantage Of Using INCOGNITO MODE:-

Advantage :-
In Incognito, none of your browsing history, cookies and site data,
or information entered in forms are saved on your device.
This means your activity doesn't show up in your Chrome browser history,
so people who also use your device won't see your activity.

Disadvantage :-
Your IP Address: While your device might not know what you're searching in incognito, 
your internet service provider does. Your ISP can still track your activity and collect your data.
This data may even be sold to third-parties. ... It can still collect your data,
which negates the purpose of incognito.
